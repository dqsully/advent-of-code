# 2023 Day X - Rust

## Part 1

### Summary

Lorem ipsum dolor

### Complexity

**`O()` time, `O()` space**

where:

- `n`: total input length

**Time analysis**: lorem ipsum dolor

**Space analysis**: lorem ipsum dolor

### Further optimizations

_Unless this was really performance-critical code, I wouldn't apply any further optimizations._ I believe my solution for part 1 is very clear, and the code complexity introduced by any further optimizations wouldn't be worth the small increases in efficiency.

There are no further optimizations for worst-case big-O complexity.

High-performance optimizations:

- This solution may also be multithreaded or converted into an ETL process if it's running at an insane scale, although at that point usually I/O bottlenecks become the main issue.

## Part 2

### Summary

Summary Summary

### Complexity

**`O()` time, `O()` space**

where:

- `n`: total input length

**Time analysis**: lorem ipsum dolor

**Space analysis**: lorem ipsum dolor

### Further optimizations

_Unless this was really performance-critical code, I wouldn't apply any further optimizations._ Etc.

There are no further optimizations for worst-case big-O complexity.

High-performance optimizations:

- This solution may also be multithreaded or converted into an ETL process, just like part 1.
